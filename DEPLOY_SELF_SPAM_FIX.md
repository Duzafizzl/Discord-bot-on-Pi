# 🚨 CRITICAL SECURITY FIX: Self-Spam Prevention Deployment

**Date:** October 16, 2025  
**Issue:** Bot creates infinite self-loops (responds to own messages)  
**Fix:** Self-Spam Prevention System  
**Priority:** 🔴 CRITICAL - Deploy ASAP

---

## 🐛 The Problem

**Yesterday's incident:** Bot created an infinite self-loop, responding to its own messages endlessly, wasting API credits.

**Root Cause:** The Bot Loop Prevention system only prevented Bot A ↔ Bot B loops, but NOT self-loops (Mioré → Mioré → Mioré...).

**Example of what happened:**
```
Mioré: "Hey everyone!"
[Autonomous mode sees own message as "relevant"]
Mioré: "Oh and another thing..."
[Sees own message again]
Mioré: "Also I wanted to mention..."
[Infinite loop! 💸💸💸]
```

---

## ✅ The Fix

### New Security Layer: Self-Spam Prevention

Added `detectSelfSpam()` function that counts **consecutive messages from our bot** without ANY other user (human or bot) responding.

**Limit:** 3 consecutive messages → Farewell + 60s cooldown

**Example of fixed behavior:**
```
Mioré: "Hey everyone!"
Mioré: "Oh and another thing..."
Mioré: "Also I wanted to mention..."
[Self-spam limit reached!]
Mioré: "Gotta step away - let's continue later! 👋"
[60 second cooldown]
[Will only respond to HUMANS for next 60s]
```

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Find Your Discord User ID (For Admin Commands)

1. Enable Developer Mode in Discord:
   - User Settings → Advanced → Developer Mode (toggle ON)
2. Right-click your username → "Copy User ID"
3. Save it for Step 3

### Step 2: Backup Current Running Code

```bash
# SSH into Pi
ssh pi@raspberrypi.local

# Backup current version
cd ~
tar -czf miore-bot-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).tar.gz miore-discord-bot/

# Verify backup created
ls -lh miore-bot-backup-*.tar.gz
```

### Step 3: Deploy New Code

```bash
# Option A: Using the deployment script (RECOMMENDED)
cd ~/miore-discord-bot
git pull origin main

# Option B: Manual copy from local machine
# (From your local machine)
rsync -av --exclude='node_modules' --exclude='.git' \
  "~/discord-bot/" \
  pi@raspberrypi.local:~/miore-discord-bot/
```

### Step 4: Update Environment Variables

```bash
# Edit .env file
cd ~/miore-discord-bot
nano .env

# Add this line (replace with YOUR User ID from Step 1):
ADMIN_USER_ID=123456789012345678

# Verify ENABLE_AUTONOMOUS is still set:
# ENABLE_AUTONOMOUS=true

# Save: Ctrl+O, Enter, Ctrl+X
```

### Step 5: Install Dependencies (if needed)

```bash
# Only needed if package.json changed
cd ~/miore-discord-bot
npm install
```

### Step 6: Restart Bot

```bash
# Restart PM2 process
pm2 restart miore-bot

# Or use the new admin command (after restart!)
# In Discord: !pm2 restart miore-bot
```

### Step 7: Verify Deployment

```bash
# Check PM2 status
pm2 list

# Check logs for startup message
pm2 logs miore-bot --lines 50

# Look for these lines:
# ✅ "🔒 Bot-Loop Prevention: ENABLED ✅"
# ✅ "🔒 Self-Spam Prevention: Active (Max 3 consecutive)"
```

### Step 8: Test in Discord

```
# Test 1: Admin Commands (should work)
!help

# Expected response:
🛠️ Admin Commands
[... list of commands ...]

# Test 2: Bot Stats (should show self-spam metrics)
!bot stats

# Expected response:
🤖 Bot Statistics
📝 Consecutive self-messages: 0/3
[... other stats ...]

# Test 3: PM2 List (should show processes)
!pm2 list

# Expected response:
✅ PM2 Command: `pm2 list`
[... process list ...]
```

## 🧪 Testing the Self-Spam Fix

### Test 1: Normal Multi-Message Response ✅

```
You: "Hey Mioré!"
Bot: "Yo!"
Bot: "Oh and btw..."
Bot: "I had an idea..."
[Bot should STOP here - 3 consecutive messages]
Bot: "I'll step away for now! 👋"
[60 second cooldown active]
```

**Expected:** Bot stops after 3 messages + farewell

### Test 2: Human Resets Counter ✅

```
Bot: "Message 1"
Bot: "Message 2"
You: "Cool!"
Bot: "Message 3" ← Counter reset by your message!
Bot: "Message 4"
Bot: "Message 5"
[NOW hits limit - 3 consecutive after your message]
```

**Expected:** Counter resets when you speak

### Test 3: Check Stats ✅

```
!bot stats
```

**Expected Response:**
```
🤖 Bot Statistics
📝 Consecutive self-messages: X/3
[... other metrics ...]
```

## 🔍 Monitoring After Deployment

### Watch for These Log Messages

**Good Signs ✅:**
```
🔒 Bot-Loop Prevention: ENABLED ✅
👤 Human message detected - bot pingpong counter reset
📊 Bot replied in channel xxx. Pingpong count: 0/1
```

**Self-Spam Prevention Working ✅:**
```
⚠️ Approaching self-spam limit in channel xxx (2/3)
🛑 SELF-SPAM DETECTED in channel xxx! Bot sent 3 consecutive messages without response!
👋 Bot sent farewell. Cooldown active for 60s
```

**Admin Commands Working ✅:**
```
✅ ADMIN COMMAND [Your-Username]: !pm2 list
✅ ADMIN COMMAND [Your-Username]: !bot stats
```

**Bad Signs 🚨:**
```
❌ ADMIN COMMAND [Someone-Else]: !pm2 stop all
   Error: Unauthorized
[This is actually GOOD - means security is working!]
```

### Check Bot Health

```bash
# Every few hours for the first day:
pm2 logs miore-bot --lines 100 | grep "🛑\|❌\|SPAM"

# Or via Discord:
!bot stats
!pm2 list
```

---

## 🚨 Rollback Plan (If Something Breaks)

### Quick Rollback

```bash
# Stop current version
pm2 stop miore-bot

# Restore backup
cd ~
tar -xzf miore-bot-backup-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.tar.gz

# Restart old version
cd miore-discord-bot
pm2 restart miore-bot
```

### Emergency Stop (via Discord)

```
!pm2 stop miore-bot
```

Then SSH in to investigate.

## 💡 New Features Available After Deployment

### Remote Admin Control

You can now control the bot from Discord:

```
!pm2 restart miore-bot      - Restart bot
!pm2 stop miore-bot          - Stop bot
!pm2 logs miore-bot          - View logs
!system status               - Check system resources
!bot stats                   - View bot statistics
!help                        - Show all commands
```

**No SSH needed!** 🎉

## 📞 Troubleshooting

### "Admin commands not responding"

1. Check ADMIN_USER_ID in `.env` matches your Discord User ID
2. Restart bot: `pm2 restart miore-bot`
3. Check logs: `pm2 logs miore-bot`

### "Bot still creating self-loops"

1. Check autonomous.js was compiled: `ls -l src/autonomous.js`
2. Check date: `date -r src/autonomous.js` (should be today)
3. If old, recompile: `npx tsc`
4. Restart: `pm2 restart miore-bot`

### "Self-spam limit too aggressive"

Edit `src/autonomous.ts`:
```typescript
const MAX_CONSECUTIVE_SELF_MESSAGES = 5; // Changed from 3
```

Then:
```bash
npx tsc
pm2 restart miore-bot
```
